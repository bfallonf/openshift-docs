Various {product-title} Networks

Module included in the following assemblies:

* architecture/networking/networking.adoc
////

The term _network_ can have several meanings within the OpenShift context:

* Cluster network: The "real" network. Controls communication between node hosts and how your infrastructure communicates on the internet. 
* Pod network: The communication between pods. Controlled using the {product-title} SDN. Defines whether pods can interact with each other (or not).

Kuberbetes ensures that pods can communicate with each other, regardless of the
node host, and allocates each pod an IP address from an internal network. This
ensures all containers within the pod behave as if they were on the same host.
Giving each pod its own IP address means that pods can be treated like physical
hosts or virtual machines in terms of port allocation, networking, naming,
service discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration.

Creating links between pods is unnecessary, and it is not recommended that
your pods talk to one another directly using the IP address. Instead, it is
recommend that you create a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service], then interact
with the service.
